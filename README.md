## current playable version <a href="https://calined.github.io/MagicalBattle/">>HERE<</a> 


## Technologies used
Javascript
Canvas
Visual Studio Code
Github.com
Gimp

## Approach Taken
Wrote Rendering and object hierarchy first
Then focused on minimum playable gameplay
Then wanted to focus on visuals, before adding more complex gameplay

## Installation Instructions
Just run the site, but you might have to refresh it again, cause the image locations are not correct at the beginning (might have to do with files not being loaded yet and sizes are being read before that)
Players take turns
they can either use A and D or the left and right arrow keys to select a card
Then they press either space or enter to confirm it

## Unsolved Problems
Lifebar is not showing up properly
In the beginning the images don't show up properly

## Planned Features
Endless card drawing/restocking
Cards that influence the other players cards
3 Player mode
Dynamic Visuals like animations, fancy graphics, simulated 3D space / camera moves around to the current player, magical attack animations
